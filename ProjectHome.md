**This extension is a [Media View](http://addons.songbirdnest.com/tag/mediaview) for [Songbird](http://getsongbird.com) and [Nightingale](http://getnightingale.com)**

The goal of this extension is to provide to the user a music quiz with songs from his library, similar to the one on [Apple's iPods](http://support.apple.com/kb/TA38514?viewlocale=en_US#2).

A random song is played, and the user has multiple choices (5 by default).
Identifying the correct title wins the user points. (You can switch and play to identify the Artist)

The number of songs and choices can be changed.
